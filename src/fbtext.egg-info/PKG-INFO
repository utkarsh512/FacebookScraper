# fbtext
Scraping posts, comments and replies from Facebook.
## How to use
Install dependencies:
```bash
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Create a `Session` object for scraping:
```python3
from fbtext import Session
sess = Session(
    credentials=(EMAIL, 
                 PASSWORD), 
    chromeDriverPath="chromedriver"
)
```
where `(EMAIL, PASSWORD)` are your facebook credentials and `chromeDriverPath` is the path to the chromedriver.

Then, you can extract recent post URLs of a public pages as
```python3
sess.getPage("nytimes")
sess.scroll(10)
postURLs = sess.getPostURLs()
```

As you now have the list of URLs for the required posts, post data (including comments) can be scraped as
```python3
sess.getPost(
    postURL="https://mbasic.facebook.com/story.php?...",
    dump="posts.pkl",
    getComments=True,
    getReplies=True,
    nComments=1000,
    nReplies=10
)
```
where 
* `postURL` is the URL of the post
* `dump` is the name of binary file used for dumping the post data
* `getComments` should be `True` if you want to scrape comments to the post as well
* `getReplies` should be `True` if you want to scrape replies to the comments as well
* `nComments` is the upper-bound on number of comments per post
* `nReplies` is the upper-bound on number of replies per comment

Just make sure postURL starts with `https://mbasic.facebook.com` instead of `https://www.facebook.com`, `https://mobile.facebook.com`, etc.
